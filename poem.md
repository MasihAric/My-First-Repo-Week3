## Thank God for Peace!

**Thank God for Peace!**

*Up to the sombre sky*

*Rolled one great thankful sigh,*

*Rolled one great gladsome cry--*

*The soul's deliverance of a mighty people.*

**Thank God for Peace!**

*The long-low-hanging war-cloud rolled away,*

*And night glowed brighter than the brightest day.*

*For Peace is Light,*

*And War is grimmer than the Night.*

**Thank God for Peace!**

*Great ocean, was your mighty calm unstirred*

*As through your depths, unseen, unheard,*

*Sped on its way the glorious word*

*That called a weary nation to ungird,*

*And sheathed once more the keen, reluctant sword?*

**Thank God for Peace!**

*The word came to us as we knelt in prayer*

*That wars might cease.*

*Peace found us on our knees, and prayer for Peace*

*Was changed to prayer of deepest thankfulness.*

*We knelt in War, we rose in Peace to bless*

*Thy grace, Thy care, Thy tenderness.*

**Thank God for Peace!**

*No matter now the rights and wrongs of it;*

*You fought us bravely, and we fought you fair.*

*The fight is done. Grip hands! No malice bear!*

*We greet you, brothers, to the nobler strife*

*Of building up the newer, larger life!*

**Join hands! Join hands! Ye nations of the stock!**

*And make henceforth a mighty Trust for Peace.*

*A great enduring peace that shall withstand*

*The shocks of time and circumstance; and every land*

*Shall rise and bless you--and shall never cease*

*To bless you--for that glorious gift of Peace.*
