## Thank God for Peace!

       _Thank God for Peace!_
    Up to the sombre sky
    Rolled one great thankful sigh,
    Rolled one great gladsome cry--
    The soul's deliverance of a mighty people.
            
        _Thank God for Peace!_
    The long-low-hanging war-cloud rolled away,
    And night glowed brighter than the brightest day.
    For Peace is Light,
    And War is grimmer than the Night.

        _Thank God for Peace!_
    Great ocean, was your mighty calm unstirred
    As through your depths, unseen, unheard,
    Sped on its way the glorious word
    That called a weary nation to ungird,
    And sheathed once more the keen, reluctant sword?

        _Thank God for Peace!_
    The word came to us as we knelt in prayer
    That wars might cease.
    Peace found us on our knees, and prayer for Peace
    Was changed to prayer of deepest thankfulness.
    We knelt in War, we rose in Peace to bless
    Thy grace, Thy care, Thy tenderness.

        _Thank God for Peace!_
    No matter now the rights and wrongs of it;
    You fought us bravely, and we fought you fair.
    The fight is done. Grip hands! No malice bear!
    We greet you, brothers, to the nobler strife
    Of building up the newer, larger life!

        Join hands! Join hands! Ye nations of the stock!
    *And make henceforth a mighty Trust for Peace.
    *A great enduring peace that shall withstand
    *The shocks of time and circumstance; and every land
    *Shall rise and bless you--and shall never cease
    *To bless you--for that glorious gift of Peace.
